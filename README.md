# FashionMNIST
CNN model to classify fashion apparels from FashionMNIST dataset

Project includes: 
- transforming data
- feeding it to a CNN model (Keras, Tensorflow) for classification
- hyperparameter tuning of the model

Do not run all cells of the notebook in one go. Hyperparameter tuning takes time to run depending on your system config. 8gb RAM recommended.
